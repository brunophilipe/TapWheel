# TapWheel
Modular and extendable iPod classic simulator for iOS

# About

I started working on this project back in September 2014. I encountered some problems with glitches and other stuff that were looking too much time, so I abandoned the whole thing. After that, many things happened, and today (Sep 3rd, 2016) I decided to pick it back up and iron out the bugs, which I did!

The app uses a very modular structure of VCs and segues, and basically reuses just two VC classes for the whole iPod simulation.
The currently implemented menus are:

* Music > Playlists > *
* Music > Artists > *
* Music > Albums > *
* Music > Songs > *
* Now Playing

Any other menu will just not work.

Feel free to contribute (as long as you follow the existing development patter) and to fiddle around.

Oh, btw, no chance of putting this in the App Store. It is explicitly forbidden.
